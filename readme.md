## Overview
The aim of the project is to build an open-source powerful
Human-Computer emotion analyzer platform for research in the field of
smartfying Indian general stores. Various deep learning and computer
vision algorithms are being implemented on the IoT hardware including
person tracking, gesture control using human pose estimation, and depth
estimation using monocular vision. The device will capture customer
movement & regulate the surrounding environment of the store like lighting,
air-conditioning & data will be further transferred to ThingSpeaks,
Google cloud for real-time visualization. It is a project that aims towards smartifying department stores, by monitoring air conditions and customer behaviour, of course while respecting their integrity. The smart store device can be installed in multiple sections in the store and once installed, data about air conditions and customer movement activity will be transmitted to the sigfox network and further on to ubidots and google cloud for real-time visualisation.
